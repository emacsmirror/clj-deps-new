You may to familiarize yourself with the basics of Transient. The [Developer Quick Start Manual](https://github.com/magit/transient/wiki/Developer-Quick-Start-Guide) and [Transient Manual](https://magit.vc/manual/transient.html#Defining-New-Commands) are good places to get started. In particular, note the section on [modifying existing transients](https://magit.vc/manual/transient.html#Modifying-Existing-Transients).
